# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
A backend E-Commerce application for an imaginary business with very few products.  Using This project through an API client such as Insomnia or Postman, you are able to perform CRUD functions on a list of products, product tags, and product categories.  This project was an excercise to get used to using Sequelize, and incorporating it into an API to perform RESTful CRUD operations.  I learned some basic Sequelize functionality but after this project I can recognize just how powerful of a tool it is, especially since it can still incorporate raw custom SQL queries.  

## Installation

- Type `NPM Install` into the terminal from the root folder to install required packages.
- In the same terminal type `mysql -u root -p` followed by your Mysql password to initialize the Mysql terminal
- Type `source db/schema.sql` to create the database, then `quit;` to exit the Mysql terminal
- Type `npm run seed` to seed the database with some sample data
- Run the app by typing `npm start`

This app does nothing on it's own.  You will need an API client such as Insomnia or Postman to interact with the different API routes.  See the attached video to see the proper routes and CRUD functions for each API route
